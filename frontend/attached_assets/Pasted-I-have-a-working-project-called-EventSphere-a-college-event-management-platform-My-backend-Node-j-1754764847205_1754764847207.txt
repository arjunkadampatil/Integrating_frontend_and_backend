I have a working project called EventSphere, a college event management platform.
My backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) is already working, and the frontend is static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the following files:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
admin-dashboard.html  
analytics.html  
club-dashboard.html  
config.js  
event.html  
forgot-password.html  
index.html  
login.html  
navbar.js  
profile.html  
qr-attendance.html  
qrcode.min.js  
reset-password.html  
signup.html  
student-dashboard.html  
style.css  
Goal
Revamp the frontend design to be modern, visually stunning, and fully responsive, while keeping all existing JavaScript functionality and backend integration intact.
The final design must look premium and feel like a professional product.

Requirements
Design Frameworks

Use Bootstrap 5 + Tailwind CSS for styling (via CDN).

Add AOS.js animations for scroll-based effects (fade, slide, zoom).

Branding & Theme

Use a professional event theme with gradient backgrounds and smooth hover effects.

Create a consistent color palette (e.g., dark blue, neon purple, white).

Include logo in the navbar (save as /assets/logo.png).

UI Enhancements

Homepage (index.html):

Hero section with background image, overlay, and a CTA button (“Explore Events”).

Preview section for trending events with event cards (image, title, date, location, category badge – Intercollege/Intracollege).

Login & Signup Pages:

Glassmorphism-style forms with blurred backgrounds.

Attractive role selection dropdown (Student / Club / Admin).

Event Page:

Grid layout for events.

Category & status badges (Trending, Popular, Approved, Pending).

Dashboards:

Student: List of registered events + Download Certificate button.

Club: Create Event form + Past Event Stats + Approval Status.

Admin: Table with event requests + Approve/Reject buttons + Assign Venue modal.

QR Attendance Page:

Display QR code in a styled card with download option.

Background Images & Assets

Store all images in /assets folder.

Use high-quality images from Unsplash/Pexels for:

Hero section

Login/Signup

Event cards

Intercollege vs Intracollege

Show category badge in event cards based on event type (e.g., green for Intercollege, blue for Intracollege).

Responsiveness

Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Optimize all layouts for small screens with mobile-friendly navbars and collapsible menus.

Keep Backend Compatibility

Do not change:

HTML element IDs

Form field names

Existing JavaScript event listeners

Ensure all existing features (login, registration, QR, certificates, payment) still work.

Bonus UI Elements

Floating animated shapes in hero section.

Smooth scroll for anchor links.

Button hover animations.

Loading spinner when fetching events.

Output
Updated .html, .css, and .js files.

/assets folder with images & logo.

Fully responsive, animated, and attractive frontend design that I can directly replace into my current project folder without breaking backend functionality.

Ekta, if you want, I can now pick the best matching background images, logo style, and color theme so the AI has exact design references while making the frontend. That way, you’ll get a ready-to-use attractive UI without trial and error.

Do you want me to prepare that image & color guide for you?

Here are four vibrant, high-quality background images perfect for transforming the hero section of your EventSphere frontend:

A dynamic, colorful silhouette of campus or club events—a great fit to evoke enthusiasm and celebration.

A soft gradient with abstract silhouettes and motion—subtle yet uplifting for a hero banner.

A stylish party-like or celebratory background—adds a festive, energetic vibe.

A sleek vector burst design—modern and striking, great for attention-grabbing call-to-action areas.

Suggested Prompt for Replit or AI Assistant
Use these images as hero section backgrounds in the redesigned EventSphere frontend. Save them into the /assets folder as hero1.jpg, hero2.jpg, etc.

“hero1.jpg” – preferred for Home Page hero (celebration silhouette).

“hero2.jpg” – ideal for forms like Login/Signup pages (soft, abstract feel).

“hero3.jpg” – great for Event listing or highlights, bringing energy and engagement.

“hero4.jpg” – use in dashboards or CTA sections to accentuate focus areas.

Use CSS layering (e.g., overlay gradients, blurred shapes) and AOS animations (fade-in, zoom) to enhance visual appeal.

Where These Images Fit Best:
Page / Section	Recommended Image	Reason
Home Hero Section	hero1.jpg	Energetic and vibrant—perfect to welcome users.
Login / Signup Forms	hero2.jpg	Soft and abstract—creates a calm, polished backdrop.
Events / Featured Cards	hero3.jpg	Festive and inviting—makes event previews pop.
Dashboards / CTA Areas	hero4.jpg	Stylish and dynamic—adds modern elegance
